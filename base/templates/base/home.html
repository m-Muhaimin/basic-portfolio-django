                    <h4>My Experience as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained hands-on experience in various
                        aspects of software development. My primary expertise lies in Python, which I have used
                        extensively to build robust applications and systems. I have also worked with C++ at an
                        intermediate level, allowing me to develop efficient and high-performance software solutions.
                        In addition, I have honed my skills in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                        and I am proficient in using Django for backend development.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>I have a strong foundation in programming languages, primarily Python, which I use for building
                        robust applications, and C++ at an intermediate level for developing efficient software
                        solutions. My frontend development skills include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while I utilize
                        Django for backend development. I have hands-on experience in designing and implementing machine
                        learning models, with a focus on recommendation systems, and I am continuously exploring the
                        latest advancements in artificial intelligence to apply innovative solutions across various domains.</p>
